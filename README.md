# CodeR
### Code Generating Made Easy!

_________
CodeR is a beta code-generating module that allows you to generate codes, store codes, and compare codes. CodeR is pretty easy to use, and interact with


```lua
local ServerStorage = game:GetService("ServerStorage")
local CodeR = require(ServerStorage.CodeR) -- Requires CodeR. Recommended to leave module in ServerStorage. If you move it, make sure to put the correct directory.

local Code = CodeR:GenerateCode() 
```
